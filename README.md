# Weather-Dash

## Description
This week, I built a weather dashboard that operates in the browser. This app connects to an OpenWeatherAPI and pulls the current weather data as well as a 5-day forecast. The cities that are searched by the user are stored in the local storage. This assignment taught me how to request and retrieve API keys, as well as how to implement them in my code. 

## Usage
The user can open this in their browser and begin to search for a city. If they need to go back to a previous search, they can use the history section to pull the data up again.
